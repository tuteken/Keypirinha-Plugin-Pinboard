[main]
# Plugin's main configuration section.

# **Required** 
# User specific API token used for accessing bookmarks.
# * Copy the user API token from this page: https://pinboard.in/settings/password,
#   and paste it below.
# * Default
api_token = 

# The prefix of the label of every catalogue item created by this plugin
# * Default: Pinboard
#item_label = Pinboard

# The format string that will be used to name every catalogue item created by this plugin.
# * It accepts the following placeholders:
#   * {label}: the actual display name of your bookmark
#   * {tags}: the tags associated with this bookmark
# * Default: "Pinboard: {label} ({tags})"
#item_label_format = Pinboard: {label} ({tags})

# Should the plugin always suggest candidates if their content
# matches the search terms?
# * Enabling this option saves you some keystrokes since you do not have to
#   search then select the prefix item first, before being able to
#   choose the application you want to activate.
# * On the other hand, this plugin pushes its results as suggestions, which
#   means items will always be at the top of the results list (i.e. in front of
#   regular catalog items). This may pollutes your results and become annoying
#   in some cases.
# * Default: no
#always_suggest = no

# Should bookmarks with a blank name be referenced?
# * If yes, blank name will be replaced by a slighlty prettier version of its
#   url. Example: a bookmark with a blank name and the URL
#   "http://www.example.com/page.html?arg=ref&stuff=ok" will be named
#   "www.example.com/page.html"
# * Default: yes
#keep_empty_names = yes

# Should bookmarks containing authentication credentials be referenced?
# * Some URL embeds authentication credentials. Such URLs are formated that way:
#   "http://user:pass@www.example.com/foo"
#   Most of the time, if you have bookmarked them, you probably don't mind about
#   having them referenced in Keyprinha neither. That is the reason why this
#   setting defaults to "yes". Still, you have the opportunity to filter them
#   out if you wish so, which means Keypirinha will not keep them.
# * Default
#keep_auth_url = yes

# When a bookmark is executed, should this plugin always hint the browser that
# you want to open it in a new window?
# * Note that this is, at best, a hint given to the web browser.
# * Specifying a value here will override the web_browser_new_window global
#   setting.
# * Default: empty value, which means plugin should rely on the
#   web_browser_new_window global setting
#force_new_window =

# When a bookmark is executed, should this plugin hint the browser that you want
# to open it in "Private Mode", a.k.a. "Incognito Mode"?
# * Note that this is, at best, a hint given to the web browser.
# * Specifying a value here will override the web_browser_private_mode global
#   setting.
# * Default: empty value, which means plugin should rely on the
#   web_browser_private_mode global setting
#force_private_mode =

[var]
# As usual in Keyprinha's configuration files, you may optionally include a
# [var] section as a placeholder for the definition of variables that are
# reusable anywhere else in this file.
#
# Also note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value
# defined in the main configuration file of the application (i.e.:
# "Keypirinha.ini") has already been made available to this file as well so you
# do not need to duplicate them here.
#
# REMINDER: Keypirinha's pre-defined values are: APP_DIR, APP_EXE, PROFILE_DIR,
# PROFILE_DIR_INSTALLED_PACKS, PROFILE_DIR_LIVE_PACKS and PROFILE_DIR_USER.
# See the documentation for more information


[env]
# As usual in Keyprinha's configuration files, the [env] section is
# automatically included and populated at runtime. It contains every user's
# environment variable.
#
# Keypirinha detects when the environment changes. When it does, the environment
# block is updated and a ENV_CHANGED message is broadcasted to every loaded
# plugins so the plugin has a chance to reload configuration if needed.
